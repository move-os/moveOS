# moveOS

The ***moveOS*** comprises of a *lightweight Kernel* with supporting libraries that greatly help in developing and deploying *movable smart-objects* covering a variety of domains. The main desirable features of the OS include:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Ease of use*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Lightweight deployments*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Energy efficiency*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Real-time responsiveness*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Task and event-based software designs*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Natively supporting the State Machines*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Graphical and headless deployments*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Remote interfacing through stand-alone graphical or cloud-based services*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Ready-to-use security and other modules*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *Low-code or no-code capabilities*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *ROS integration*
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;:star:&nbsp;&nbsp; *High configurability*

## Run-time Environments

From the beginning, the ***moveOS*** is intended to be deployed on bare-metal devices, Windows and Linux distributions; though, its behavior can change depending on deployed environments and underlying hardware features.



&nbsp;

## Modules

***moveOS*** comprises of two types of modules i.e., Compiled with the Kernel itself, and the ones loaded as pure modules that can be unloaded at any time - just like the Linux Kernel modules.
